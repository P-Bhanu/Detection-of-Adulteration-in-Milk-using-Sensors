Designed and implemented Arduino-based and analog circuit systems to detect common milk adulterants using pH, TDS, turbidity, and conductivity measurements.

Built an Arduino UNO prototype with real-time sensor integration, calibrated thresholds, and adulteration alerts via LED indicators and serial outputs.

Developed a low-cost analog circuit solution (op-amps, comparators, optical/electrical sensing) for binary detection without microcontrollers.

Evaluated trade-offs: Arduino system offered precision, flexibility, and IoT integration; analog system provided simplicity and affordability.

Strengthened skills in embedded programming, sensor interfacing, and analog circuit design for practical food quality monitoring applications.
